Some of the entries has a wee bit of interactivity. See if you can discover the means to interact \nwith them without opening the .gam files! Starry Skies uses sequenced one-channel .wav music!

I thought I would have plenty of time to pack my stuff up, but little did I know that the \nowner of the cottage had arranged for a horde of zombies to swarm in at 7pm and devour anyone who hadn't left \nyet! I guess this was to discourage lazy bums like me from hanging around after check-out time. The remainder \nof the dream involved picking up all my junk from around the cottage and its garden, while evading or fighting \noff zombies.  This is the game of that dream, created in Game Maker 7. Your goal is to pick up your five \nremaining t-shirts and stuff them into the bag before the zombies get you. There is no sound because I wasted \nfar too much time drawing zombies.

 "Descr": "Created because of the annoyance the Icelandic volcano caused me earlier this year. Fortunately the volcano \nstopped before I had to fly out of the country this Summer. I went way, way, way over time on this. My three \nexcuses are 1. this is my first KotMK 2. I was mainly held up by my lack of knowledge of Game Maker and 3. \nbecause I didn't have much time to spend on it this week... Anyway, it's a 2 player game. Pick your side, \nIceland or Volcano and mash the appropriate button shown underneath the pictures to charge up attacks. Use Q \nand O to fire attacks for Iceland and Volcano respectively. Volcano does more damage and can use Smog to hide \nIceland's input buttons but Iceland can heal itself. Enjoy!",

Instead, matching cards gradually reveals a password hidden beneath the playing field. Enter the \npassword as soon as you can see what it is, and you've won the round. Faster games, with less needless and \naimless clicking, is Memory Improved's promise. \"Diddled Bits\" font by Anne Thoreau \nP.",

 "Descr": "DISCLAIMER: This took four hours to make, which is inexcusable. The only consolation in this is that it's a \nmuch higher quality game than I normally turn in. My original idea was to make some kind of EXTREME TENNIS \ngame where the ball was a grenade and the players were carrying machine guns, but because I couldn't be \nbothered to put in a net or introduce bounce physics and stuff I ended up making GRENADE PONG instead. Each \nplayer is equipped with a gun and a forcefield. Like Pong, the aim of the game is to bat the grenade off the \nopposite side of the screen. Unlike pong, you can only deflect the ball when your forcefield is activated, and \nyour forcefield only stays active for about 1/3rd of a second each time you use it (and takes just over 1 \nsecond to recharge). If you touch the bomb while your forcefield is inactive, you lose instantly. But wait - \nthere's more! You can't move and fire. Your characters will automatically aim towards each other, but while \nyou hold down the Fire key you will be able to adjust your aim by pressing your move up/move down keys. \nBullets will not kill you, but will hinder your movement around the court - your forcefield will not protect \nyou from this! Bullets do not affect the bomb in any way. CONTROLS: Player 1: WASD to move, G to shoot, Y to \nuse forcefield Player 2: Arrow keys to move, Page Down to shoot, Page Up to use forcefield You only play one \nround at a time and the game will automatically return to the title screen after each round.

For the effect to be successful, you must have 2 \neyes and be able to cross them and focus at will.  If you are someone who struggles to see magic eye pictures, \nyou will likely have issues here. Disclaimer:  Use this software at your own risk.  Remember, your momma \nalways told you if you kept making that face, it might freeze that way... well, she's probably right.  I will \nnot be held responsible.  Okay.  Thanks.  Hopefully the icons in the tool palette will be self explanatory.  \nHave fun!",

BELOW randomly swaps its bottom-screen player-character and top-screen antagonist \nwith those from several such vertical arcade games, demonstrating that the vertical dynamic inherent in these \ngames allows such match-ups to be both playable and interesting.

 "Descr": "This is a quick mod in which I merged Anna's good game Tombed and my hack Tombed II into the same game, and \nalso providing a means of making your own levels for it. There's no editor yet, but you can use Notepad for \nnow. The way I did this was by exporting the level data into a very basic text file format. At the 'victory' \nline, Jane will do a victory dance until she is made to start falling again (which can be instantly). At the \n'breakup' line, the skewers will start to stick to blocks that happen to be underneath them, causing the floor \nto open so that Jane can exit. Jane wins by falling below the 598th line. As for the game - pick the left side \nto play Tombed, right to play Tombed II, and middle to get an Open File dialog to play any text file. (Note: \nno file error checking in this version yet.)",

The game itself was finished in the allowed \ntime, but the music took another small hour. Oh, and I used flash (sorry for that...)  Click on \"CAKE\" to \nbegin, use the Arrow Keys to move Febe around. It's a combination between Pacman and one of those ice level \nthings that you have to do in ice caves in Pokemon. Eating all the cakes will unlock all the locks and allow \nyou to leave the level. Locks without a block can be pasted through and will turn into lockblocks when you go \nover them. I don't know why you leave blocks behind you, but otherwise the game is unplayable, so I guess \nthat's the reason :P. Oh and my sister's called Febe (which is like Phoebe, but Dutch) Press 'R' if you get \nstuck!",

And I can't run klik n play so I decided to try to make a game in LUA with Polycode because \nI have not written a program in LUA before. I started at 9:19 PM. At 10:22 PM I built and checked in the \nversion attached as LuaTest.polyapp above. I then spent the next hour attempting to change the player object \nfrom a square to a triangle, then discovering that due to bugs in Polycode (it's pretty new) it is not \npossible to make a triangle in LUA right now, then filing bug reports against Polycode. I never got any \nfurther than the 10:22 version. I had been trying to implement Asteroids. But I DID FINISH THIS ONE FILE \nWITHIN THE TWO HOUR LIMIT so here you go. In order to run the attached polyapp file: In other words: YOU CAN'T \nRUN THIS IT'S BROKEN. I have no idea why but the .polyapp works with the version of PolyCode Player I built \nmyself and have on my laptop here, but doesn't work with the official version of PolyCode Player, even though \nthey ought to be the same. This Lua stuff is hard :( Since you can't play this unless you are in the same \nbuilding as me, I suggest looking at the screen shot and pretending that you are pressing the arrow keys and \nit's making the little black rectangle zoom around and all the little rectangle things are bouncing off it and \nwhen you hold up and right you just zoom faster and faster, imparting momentum on all the little rectangles, \nuntil they're gliding around and bouncing off each other like broken glass suspended in air. ps here's the \nsource code, the uploaded version is revision bc2833073e00 https://bitbucket.org/runhello/luatest",

Most of the stuff in \n\"gamesystem\" is pre-existing. I built it up on and off over the course of the last several weeks. The game \nitself I started maybe a day early (most of the content was actually done within the two-hour period however). \nKlua is still a HUGE work in progress. Don't use it for any games yet. In particular, it's missing support for \nany adequate interaction between entities (namely, there's no collision detection yet). Hopefully that will be \nadded soon. Anyway, enjoy. I'm only leaving the .love file here for now. You'll need to install Love2D \nyourself and then drag the .love file over love.exe to run the game.

Shop \nupgrades and items will aid you in both areas. Eventually you'll find killer whales and they don't care \nwhether you're shocking them or hooking them, you need to do serious damage to keep them away and that's only \npossible with the anti-shark items.  Electric Rods allow you to fish by holding down the mouse button Trash \nTraps are cheap and do little damage Sea Mines instantly kill a shark/orca and damage neighbors. Shark Hunter \nXS's make great long-term additions to your defense Also, I don't support shark or whale violence. They're \ncool animals, don't hurt one unless you or another person are in serious danger and have no other \noption.",
