You help the warehouse keeper to push the boxes around the maze of the room so that, at the end, all \nboxes are on marked fields. The only restrictions are that the warehouse keeper can only push a box, never \npull, and that just one box may be pushed at a time. Each level has a different structure, which requires a \ndifferent solution, often with a different strategy as well. The magic of the game is that boxes, which are \nout of the way on one move, might be in the way on the next move. The clearness of the rules, in combination \nwith so many levels ranging from easy to extremely difficult, have made Sokoban become a real \nclassic.",
