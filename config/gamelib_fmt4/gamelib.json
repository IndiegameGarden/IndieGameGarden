Some of the entries has a wee bit of \ninteractivity. See if you can discover the means to interact with them without opening the .gam files! Starry \nSkies uses sequenced one-channel .wav music!

At the end of the week, they \nall packed their bags and left, while I arrogantly sat in the empty cottage surrounded by dirty clothes and \nbooks and stuff. I thought I would have plenty of time to pack my stuff up, but little did I know that the \nowner of the cottage had arranged for a horde of zombies to swarm in at 7pm and devour anyone who hadn't left \nyet! I guess this was to discourage lazy bums like me from hanging around after check-out time. The remainder \nof the dream involved picking up all my junk from around the cottage and its garden, while evading or fighting \noff zombies.  This is the game of that dream, created in Game Maker 7. Your goal is to pick up your five \nremaining t-shirts and stuff them into the bag before the zombies get you. There is no sound because I wasted \nfar too much time drawing zombies. The game maker file for the game is included in the zip, in case anyone is \ninterested in checking it out for some reason.",

This, in stark contrast, is the TRUE CANONICAL Tower of Hanoi puzzle, with SIXTY-FOUR rings to move, \nstep by step, peg by peg! And, when this hallowed and sacred puzzle is brought to completion, it is said that \nthe ENTIRE UNIVERSE will CEASE TO EXIST. Now you can have the harbinger of all undoing on your miniscule hard \ndrive! And, as an added feature that almost none of our competitors can boast, this simulation will \nAUTOMATICALLY SOLVE this puzzle in the fastest manner possible! No human interaction is needed, for any move \nwould surely be less optimal than that chosen by this perfect algorithm! Sit back in reverent awe and terror \nas the end of all things is brought ever closer before your tear-filled eyes! A helpful counter is also \nprovided to tally each move as it is made.",

And that Atari game is not a nostalgic re-make of a popular \nshoot-em-up or a new take on an iconic action-adventure, but a set of playable poetry that owes as much to \nWilliam Carlos Williams as it does to Will Wright. jolifanto bambla o falli bambla großiga m'pfa habla horem \negiga goramen higo bloiko russula huju hollaka hollala anlogo bung blago bung blago bung bosso fataka ü üü \nü schampa wulla wussa olobo hej tatta gorem eschige zunbada wulubu ssubudu uluwu ssubudu –umf kusa gauma \nImagine snow is falling Imagine it's falling everywhere forever just let it keep on falling and falling and it \njust keeps going hoo boy",

"Descr": "DISCLAIMER: This took four hours to make, which is inexcusable. The only consolation in this is that it's a \nmuch higher quality game than I normally turn in. My original idea was to make some kind of EXTREME TENNIS \ngame where the ball was a grenade and the players were carrying machine guns, but because I couldn't be \nbothered to put in a net or introduce bounce physics and stuff I ended up making GRENADE PONG instead. Each \nplayer is equipped with a gun and a forcefield. Like Pong, the aim of the game is to bat the grenade off the \nopposite side of the screen. Unlike pong, you can only deflect the ball when your forcefield is activated, and \nyour forcefield only stays active for about 1/3rd of a second each time you use it (and takes just over 1 \nsecond to recharge). If you touch the bomb while your forcefield is inactive, you lose instantly. But wait - \nthere's more! You can't move and fire. Your characters will automatically aim towards each other, but while \nyou hold down the Fire key you will be able to adjust your aim by pressing your move up/move down keys. \nBullets will not kill you, but will hinder your movement around the court - your forcefield will not protect \nyou from this! Bullets do not affect the bomb in any way. CONTROLS: Player 1: WASD to move, G to shoot, Y to \nuse forcefield Player 2: Arrow keys to move, Page Down to shoot, Page Up to use forcefield You only play one \nround at a time and the game will automatically return to the title screen after each round. Windows only; \nmade in Game Maker 7; .zip includes GM7 file.",

This is the dungeon.  Deal yourself \nthree cards.  These are your starting weapons. Your goal is to clear out the dungeon of all enemies.  To fight \nan enemy:   - Play one or more cards from the card in your hand on top of a card in the dungeon.  If it is \nface-down, turn it up.   - If the sum of the value of the cards played is less than or equal to the value of \nthe enemy you are fighting, you are killed and the game ends immediately.   - If the sum of the value of the \ncards played is greater than the value of the enemy you are fighting, you kill the enemy.  Discard the cards \nthat you played, and put the enemy card into your hand.   - After the battle is over (and you survive to fight \nanother turn), you do two things:     1. Reveal a card directly adjacent to the enemy that was defeated (no \ndiagonals).     2. Optionally take a card from the top of the deck.  If you decide to do so, you must then \ndiscard either the card that you just took from the deck, or the enemy card that you just won from the battle. \nJack - 11 Queen - 12 King - 13 Ace - 14 ----",

You can also make the snake's tail longer if you want. The game \nfeatures a random seed, so you can keep playing the same pattern over and over until you better yourself. \nThree game modes: Score Attack just gives you points for however long you stay alive. Timed Survival is about \nstaying alive for the specified time period. If you're still around when the time is up, you win! Update: \nFixed an issue with past/high score not being remembered on custom games. Also provided more sane default \nvalues. Redownload if you've already downloaded.",

If you take \nmore than 45 clicks, you lose the round and get a new board. After losing a round, your current points tally \nis emptied into your total points tally. Except there's not much point, because these tallies will be \nforgotten when you close the game. Which is what you should be doing, because this game \nsucks!",

When your toy boat fills up with water, you must empty it by shaking it or else it will half-capsize. \nHold Ctrl and mash Space to shake the water out of the toy boat. Press the X in the top-right corner of the \nwindow to stop playing this game. Which is what you should be doing because much like Winning Square, this \ngame sucks.",

You can attract the mice with cheese by holding the right mouse button (best done in light taps) but you \nonly have a limited amount, and using it drains your points.

Note that the two games aren't one-to-one representations of \neach other and very quickly get de-synced. Not entirely sure if I played a game like this before. Was fun to \nmake regardless. Controls: Player 1: W/S Edit:  - Fixed a silly bounds error that prevented the inner paddles \nand ball from moving in the entire outer ball.  - Fixed an asymmetry in the paddle \npositions.",

In many \nsuch games, the player occupies the bottom half of the screen, and the CPU opponent controls the top half. \nEvery five seconds, ABOVE v. BELOW randomly swaps its bottom-screen player-character and top-screen antagonist \nwith those from several such vertical arcade games, demonstrating that the vertical dynamic inherent in these \ngames allows such match-ups to be both playable and interesting. Play the game using only the mouse! This \nmashes up the following games (don't read if you don't want spoilers): * Pong * Breakout * Space Invaders * \nPinball * Missile Command * Pang (a.k.a Buster Bros) There's no sound because I didn't feel like \nit.",

This is a quick mod in which I merged Anna's good game Tombed and \nmy hack Tombed II into the same game, and also providing a means of making your own levels for it. There's no \neditor yet, but you can use Notepad for now. The way I did this was by exporting the level data into a very \nbasic text file format. The first line is \"1\" if you want left-right wraparound, or \"0\" if you don't. The \nsecond line is \"1\" if you want bottom spikes (\"skewers\"), or \"0\" if you don't. The third line is the line \nnumber where, when the top half of Jane enters, Jane does a victory dance. The fourth line is the line number \nwhere the skewers, if any, start to break up. Then there's at most 598 lines of text that are, at most, 8 \ncharacters long. Missing lines are assumed to be blank. # - metal block B - blue block G - green block C - \ncyan block O - wild block ! - upper-left corner of checkpoint where Jane respawns. Jane is 2 blocks by 2 \nblocks tall. Checkpoints trigger as soon as Jane reaches their Y position. $ - non-solid gold (as in Tombed). \nDoesn't obey gravity. * - solid gold that Jane can stand on. It obeys gravity and can sit on skewers, but is \ndestroyed by spikes. . - solid gold only appears here if Jane respawns near here. Use this to make gold \npersist from checkpoint to checkpoint. @ - the upper-left corner of the 'debug point'. Jane will start a new \ngame here without the opening cutscene, and with the spikes and skewers lowered appropriately. She will also \nrespawn here regardless of any checkpoints. At the 'victory' line, Jane will do a victory dance until she is \nmade to start falling again (which can be instantly). At the 'breakup' line, the skewers will start to stick \nto blocks that happen to be underneath them, causing the floor to open so that Jane can exit. Jane wins by \nfalling below the 598th line. As for the game - pick the left side to play Tombed, right to play Tombed II, \nand middle to get an Open File dialog to play any text file. (Note: no file error checking in this version \nyet.)",

Eating all the cakes will unlock all the locks and allow \nyou to leave the level. Locks without a block can be pasted through and will turn into lockblocks when you go \nover them. I don't know why you leave blocks behind you, but otherwise the game is unplayable, so I guess \nthat's the reason :P. Oh and my sister's called Febe (which is like Phoebe, but Dutch) Press 'R' if you get \nstuck! Hope you enjoy! :D",

And I can't run klik n play so I decided to try to make a game in LUA with Polycode because \nI have not written a program in LUA before. I started at 9:19 PM. At 10:22 PM I built and checked in the \nversion attached as LuaTest.polyapp above. I then spent the next hour attempting to change the player object \nfrom a square to a triangle, then discovering that due to bugs in Polycode (it's pretty new) it is not \npossible to make a triangle in LUA right now, then filing bug reports against Polycode. I never got any \nfurther than the 10:22 version. I had been trying to implement Asteroids. But I DID FINISH THIS ONE FILE \nWITHIN THE TWO HOUR LIMIT so here you go. In order to run the attached polyapp file: - Go to \nhttp://polycode.org, click \"Downloads\" - Download \"Polycode Player ONLY\" for the appropriate operating system. \n- Open the Polyapp file using the Polycode Player. In other words: YOU CAN'T RUN THIS IT'S BROKEN. I have no \nidea why but the .polyapp works with the version of PolyCode Player I built myself and have on my laptop here, \nbut doesn't work with the official version of PolyCode Player, even though they ought to be the same. This Lua \nstuff is hard :( Since you can't play this unless you are in the same building as me, I suggest looking at the \nscreen shot and pretending that you are pressing the arrow keys and it's making the little black rectangle \nzoom around and all the little rectangle things are bouncing off it and when you hold up and right you just \nzoom faster and faster, imparting momentum on all the little rectangles, until they're gliding around and \nbouncing off each other like broken glass suspended in air. ps here's the source code, the uploaded version is \nrevision bc2833073e00 https://bitbucket.org/runhello/luatest",

They're cool animals, don't hurt one unless you or another person are in serious danger and have no \nother option. Based on a Kickstarter supporters idea:",

Maneuver the ship using the WASD keys.  \nCollide with asteroids to harvest the fuel inside. Use this fuel to power your warp-jump drives. Each jump \ncosts 1 kilofuel and each asteroid contains 0.1kF. You must keep jumping. They are always near. With every \njump you make, crew members will take the chance to escape into the Warp Stream.  They will find you after 7 \nseconds. --- This game is inspired by the first episode of the 2005 re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica. I \nreally liked the idea of always knowing when the enemy is going to turn up and not being able to do anything \nabout it. If I had lots of time I'd make more of a strategic game idea of it, but as it goes it's pretty \nfrantic. All the sounds were made using http://www.bfxr.net/ and the game itself was made using \nflashpunk.",

"Descr": "On the advice of a friend, I decided to throw my hat into this 'glorious train wreck' event. Considering the \nshort amount of time allowed, I approached this game with the intent of shattering the expectations of a \ngenre. But what genre? The quest, of course. The well from which all games draw from. Quests you have seen \nbefore are static, unsatisfying: each has a beginning, a middle, an end. Exposition, action, and denouement. \nWhat if there was something more? There now is.  I abolished all such crude approximations of reality in \nfavour of a more holistic approach: the game only dies when you do. You could run this game on a dedicated \ncomputer and, every morning, continue in your quest, until the day you finally expire.  I wished to also \nexpress the intriguing contrast between man and trees: we move around, always in a hurry, always someplace to \nbe. Trees are not like us; they are idle, cursed to a life of constant reflection. And yet, we both die. What \nif the trees were just like us? In this game, you will be given the opportunity to reflect on life itself, \njust as the trees do. Please do not squander it. Play this game as slowly as you can, and explore the \nthousands of options and choices it provides. You will also, of course, require a sword. But to craft one, you \nwill need to destroy the prerequisite amount of trees -- your only allies, your emotional counterpart. This is \nwhat we in the industry call \"moral choices\". Crafting weapons from wood, I should not have to say, is \nborrowed from the early nineties adventure game \"Robinson's Requiem\". Any quest, of course, requires enemies. \nYour enemies here are all red, unsightly creatures that shamble around the world in a state of perpetual \nconfusion. A commentary on racism and the over-reliance of psycho-stimulant drugs on our children? That is for \nyou to decide. The story in this game, implied, and never outright stated, rewards those who lean in for a \ncloser look.  Make no mistake: you will experience emotions during this game. All of them.  All this forms my \nnewest classic: URQUEST. A fitting title -- implying it is the first quest, despite following so many others. \nThat is because this is the beginning of a new era in quests, in adventures, in games. URQUEST could be the \ngreatest game you've ever played, or the worst. The choice is yours.  What will you decide? (Please excuse the \ncrudity of the illustration; I had only forty percent of the 3D models rendered and bumped before the allotted \ntwo hours had expired and was forced to use 'pixel art'.)",

"Descr": "Avoid cats, pick up poo. When I was a kid (10? 11?) I got a copy of HURG for the ZX Spectrum ( \nhttp://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=HURG ). While I'd made little games and things in BASIC, \nHURG let me make \"real games\" - the sort of thing you could show your mates. I used this newfound power one \nday to make fun of another kid whose kitchen was always filled with cat crap. Oh, how we laughed. Because I \nstill feel bad about making a kid feel bad (sorry Darren!) I felt the best way to atone would be to make some \nother kids feel happy. So I asked my 6 year-old daughter and the neighbour kids (8 and 9 I think?) if they \nwanted to make a game. Their eyes lit up and graphics and sound effects and ideas spewed out of them, and \ntheir enthusiasm was only slightly dampened by my explanation that the game we'd be making would be simple. \nThat it involved poo sealed the deal, and within a couple of hours we had everything ready to go. It's fairly \nsimilar to the original game I made, though I don't think I ever got around to adding the \ncats.",

After attending a mindless party full of shallow discussions in Paris, he feels a need \nto escape and decides to run away with his baby-sitter, an ex-girlfriend, Marianne Renoir (Anna Karina), \nleaving his wife and children and bourgeois lifestyle. Following Marianne into her apartment and finding a \ncorpse, Ferdinand soon discovers that Marianne is being chased by OAS gangsters, two of whom they barely \nescape. Pierrot (the unwelcome nickname Marianne gives to Ferdinand during their time together), and Marianne \ngo on a traveling crime spree from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea in the dead man's car. They lead an \nunorthodox life, always on the run. Settling down in the French Riviera after having burnt the dead man's car \n(full of money) and sunk a second car into the Mediterranean Sea, their relationship becomes strained. \nFerdinand ends up reading books, philosophizing and writing in his diary. Marianne becomes bored of the Robert \nLouis Stevenson-ness of their living situation and insists they return to town, where in a night-club they \nmeet one of their pursuers. The gangsters waterboard Ferdinand and depart. In the confusion, Marianne and \nFerdinand are separated, with Marianne traveling in search of Ferdinand and Ferdinand settling in Toulon. \nAfter their eventual reunion, Marianne uses Ferdinand to get a suitcase full of money before running away with \nher real boyfriend, to whom she had previously referred as her brother. Pierrot shoots Marianne and her \nboyfriend, and, in the climactic scene, paints his face blue and decides to blow himself up by tying sticks of \nred and yellow dynamite to his head. Regretting his decision at the last second, he tries to extinguish the \nfuse, but he is blinded by the dynamite and is blown up. THE \nGAME.",

"Descr": "Vindication is a traditional RPG created in RPG Maker 2003 over the course of more than five years. It uses a \nreal-time battle system similar to Final Fantasy games from the SNES and PSX eras. The game is about 15-30 \nhours long and features several side-quests and multiple difficulty settings, with eight major playable \ncharacters. Vindication is a constant barrage of off-the-wall comedy; a game where eccentric characters \nencounter absurd situations non-stop.  The humor assaults the player at full-speed as the characters are \nassaulted by 80s style robots from the future, struck by meteors, and forced to take pity on villains who try \ntheir best to be evil but fail miserably.  But in its more serious moments, Vindication is primarily the story \nof one man, James Clyde.  His quest for revenge against those who have wronged him rules his life, but begins \nto conflict with his desire to protect his daughter, while a force capable of destroying the world is left \nunchecked, even encouraged.  It is an epic tragedy hidden within a whirlwind of wacky hijinks and terrible \npuns. While unarguably a story-driven game, Vindication also strives to create a meaningful challenge for the \nplayer.  Each character has a unique set of abilities which must be utilized to their fullest to overcome a \nvariety of obstacles. Constant party changes and splits keep you on your toes and require you to come up with \nnew battle strategies constantly, while still rewarding you for developing your team members and building your \nstrength. On the harder difficulty setting, the game plays almost like a survival horror game, with very \nlimited resources and no way to replenish them, forcing you to manage your items wisely in order to survive \nthe dungeons and defeat the bosses, which are stronger and faster than \nusual.",

"Descr": "Install: Play: Arrows keys move. Fill the combo meter to increase rate of fire. Lengthy Description: I have \nalways been interested in concepts surrounding the mind and how we might one day share thoughts as easily as \nwe have conversations. Its one of the reasons I really liked the movie Inception so much. It also got me \nthinking about how we could do something like this with a video game. More specifically the question was \n“Could you plant an idea in someone’s head through playing a game?” Obviously something like that would \nbe incredibly difficult so I scaled it back a bit to “Could I evoke an specific emotion in a player without \nthem realizing it?” I chose fear because it seemed the easiest to me and the goal was simple. Without \nparticularly scary looking imagery or scary sounds could I give the player the impression of fear? Here is the \ngame concept I came up with: The setting is simple. You are a volunteer for the Pel Company (based on the \nFinish word pelko which means fear). You handler is Broadus (After John B. Watson for his famous study on \n“Little Albert”) who guides you through 13 “simulations” which you are told are helping to test a new \nbrain-computer interface system. The game-play itself is quite simple. The area you play in is a small maze \nwith enemies scattered around it. Your goal is to eliminate these enemies to proceed to the next level. To \nincorporate the fear element I themed each of the levels to be based on a simple fear. The first level is a \ntutorial. The enemies are cockroaches and the maze is designed to look like you are underground. The idea was \nto invoke the feeling of creepiness if you were to crawl underground and find a batch of bugs down there. My \nidea was to start with more base fears and move on to more and more abstract concepts. Here is the list of \nlevels: Level 2 – Snakes Level 3 – Spiders Level 4 – Ghosts Level 5 – Clowns Level 6 – Other People \nLevel 7 – Tornadoes Level 8 – Intimacy Level 9 – Commitment Level 10 – Money Level 11 – Public \nSpeaking Level 12 – Failure As for the motivation of the character in the game you are actually committing a \nsort of psychic murder. Pel Co. paints it as you doing various “simulations”, but these simulations are \nactually you interacting with another sentient mind. More importantly you are trying to destroy it. The text \nbetween levels is the mind attempting to communicate with you. It’s trying to tell you that you are killing \nit. How are you killing it you might ask? My idea was that, by confronting the fears this other mind has, you \nare destroying its psyche. More specifically you are getting rid of its fear of death and therefore forcing it \nto let itself die. For the communication sections there is actually a theme behind each stage. I chose the \nfive stages of grief and distributed them as evenly as I could across the 13 levels. You will notice the tone \nof the messages changes according to this distribution: 1. Denial / Isolation (Level 1 – 4) 2. Anger (Level \n5 – 7) 3. Bargaining (Level 8 – 9) 4. Depression (Level 10 – 12) I ran into several limitations. Mostly \nto do with my artistic ability, but also what could be done in 2D web game. Although I am pretty happy with \nthe final result when releasing it into the wild it got very negative reactions. I think this is mostly \nbecause no one actually got what I was going for here and just saw it as kind of a crappy 2D shooter. I blame \nmyself for this failure since if no one gets what you are trying to do then obviously you have done it wrong. \nI would like to explore this concept deeper, but I think I would need to work closely with an artist to really \nget the visual design I am looking for.",

"Descr": "Decided I would go ahead and get the first episode out even though there's still five days to go. This episode \npretty much establishes the main plot. I tried to go for something coherent instead of just all-out random. \nHopefully I did a decent job on expanding Yellow Jogger as a character. Also this has the first two levels of \nthe game, which are both pretty short.",

On each bounce, the ball's point value \nincreases by the number of times it has already bounced - so repeatedly bounced balls can, after a while, \nbecome very lucrative indeed. You have 1024 balls and have to get as high a score as you can with them. What's \nthe most profitable way to do so? I'm not sure. Work it out yourself. Use the mouse to move the \npaddle.",

So of course upon hearing this \nwell-meaning but obviously misguided advice, I decided to make One-Button GIRP. Hold in the space bar to \ngather strength, release to launch yourself in the air.  You grab handholds automatically, assuming you're not \nmoving too fast to grab onto it.  (In practice this means your \"jumps\" have to be pretty carefully \ncalibrated.) Sound effects by Daphny.",

The editing tool is not terribly far away from being publicly \nreleasable; mostly just some web backend stuff that needs tightening up.

"Descr": "Yesterday I got an email in my inbox asking for my participation (as a \"employee\" aka \"useful idiot\") in a \npenny stock scam. I've been caught up in one before, so I felt inspired to convey the general tone and feeling \nof such operations in ZZT form. Although this game is fictional, the techniques described are pretty close to \nreality. One only needs to visit InvestorsHub and browse around a little to find shining examples of this \nparticular formula in action. It really is all about emotional state and maintaining that balance of \"fear vs. \ngreed\" to keep the victim involved. But eventually your money disappears, and....well, nothing happens after \nthat! (I came out of it okay, in the end.) Some of the techniques not depicted in this game:  -Encourage a \n\"community\" of victims and make them start reassuring each other and reaching out to their friends to help in \nrationalizing a logically unsound investment(a friend got me drawn in, in my own case) -Include accomplices to \nmake in-person visits to victims that support your image. They could be \"partners,\" \"common men made \nmillionares,\" \"skeptics,\" or any number of character archetypes that weave a story that barely holds itself \ntogether. The sky's the limit. -Turn business into war - e.g. \"get back at the evil bankers manipulating the \nmarket\" or \"help revolutionize (industry x)\". If the foes are big and vague, they're easy to blame, and your \ncause looks all the better, regardless of how poor its fundamentals are. ...A start-up funded through two \nrounds of engineering and now with a manufacturing agreement in place with a NASDAQ traded global top ten \ncontract manufacturer. ...A former computer science professor at USC, Sacramento commented on *redacted* as \nfollows: “Based on my experience, I can testify that this is a fresh idea, highly innovative, and, in my \nopinion, something that the general public would love to use. Most users do belong to several social networks. \nThis tool makes the social network environment easy to navigate … and user friendly. This is a required \napplication on the same level as something like Instagram. Instagram fell into an innovative and rapid to \nmarket category, which captured a large market really fast. *redacted* has similar characteristics and falls \ninto this category of being innovative and reaching a large market.” (I followed up to that email telling \nthe guy \"I don't work for equity, but I will work for $250,000 up front\" and he politely declined. He doesn't \nknow what he's missing out on...)",

MOUTH and GEM will \nbe present on the field! DR. MOUTH has very slippery fingers, and tends to drop the GEMS very easily, most \noften when RONALD or a clone of him touches a GEM. If two GEMS touch each other, they will vanish back to \nsafety in the hands of the ROYAL APPLE FAMILY. If no GEMS are present on the screen DR. MOUTH will be likely \nto drop another onto the field, but not before RONALD CATJUMPER can use the moment to create a CLONE of \nhimself! Good luck, players! THE SCORING: 0-1: You are awful. You should be ashamed of yourself. 2-10: The \nROYAL APPLE FAMILY will live in poverty forever. You jerk. 11-40: Pretty good, but DR. MOUTH has made off with \nmost of the GEMS! 41-70: Great work!  71-100: You're awesome!",

The evil DR. I. \nBOWL, along with his assistant FIREPANTS, stole RONALD CATJUMPER's (ed note: see the first SOCKRUNE game for \nhis story!) and used it to create an army of clones of his two henchmen, ZOMBUTT and GOOD DRAGON. The amassed \narmy is right outside of WERLIN's castle, and DR. I. BOWL plans to steal his RUNE OF SOCKS! Without this \nmagical rune, WERLIN would be unable to use his SOCK MAGIC! GAMEPLAY WERLIN, as a powerful wizard, has many \nspells! Unfortunately the army of DR. I. BOWL has already broken into WERLIN's castle and smashed many of the \nrunes that give WERLIN his power. All that's left is the RUNE OF SOCKS, which allows WERLIN to fire deadly \nsocks in any of 8 directions (SHIFT KEY). WERLIN is well versed in the magic of moving around quickly in any \ndirection without much effort (ARROW KEYS). Through use of his SOCK RUNE, WERLIN was able to create a force \nfield around him to protect himself from harm. Unfortunately due to his weakened power it can only take 10 \nhits. Luckily, DR. I. BOWL and FIREPANTS will be unable to hurt him, but they can give WERLIN a nasty shove - \npossibly into another baddie! SCORING 0-20 You didn't even try!! 21-50 You're doing OK, but WERLIN still lost \nhis RUNE OF SOCKS! 51-100 Maybe you will be able to fight off the invaders better with more practice. 101-150 \nKeep it up WERLIN! 151-200 You fought off more than half of the attackers! 201-250 Great job! 251-299 \nAwesome!",

"Descr": "So this is an adventure game designed entirely by my 4.5 year old son Eric. He was playing a lot of Putt-Putt \nSaves The Zoo at the time.  He started joking about Putt-Putt having to save other rhyming things (we do a lot \nof dumb punning), and we started talking about what Putt-Putt Saves The Stew would be like, and pretty soon we \nhad agreed to set aside a big chunk of a Saturday actually making it. I tried as much as possible to let him \ndesign everything without my input; my job was just to find out what his vision was and turn it into reality.  \nWe started by writing a little design document (spoilers!), where we hashed out what the central conflict was, \nand who the characters are, and what the puzzles would be. Next we worked out the details of the geography of \nthe game by drawing a map (spoilers!); I started drawing a few squares and linking them together, but pretty \nsoon he got the idea and insisted on taking over. Then we split up while he drew a bunch of art, and I started \ngetting familiar with Adventure Game Studio. Once I had a skeleton of the game in place, including scanning \nand putting in all of his artwork, we started to write and record dialogue.    Basically, for all of the \nsituations I could think of, I just asked him what he thought should happen, and I coded it up as we went. \nHints / Tidbits / Easter Eggs: There is only one ending, at his insistence.  It is morbid. Nobody has \nkidnapped the baby vegetables.  There is no antagonist.  They were just out walking and accidentally wandered \ninto the cages and the doors locked behind them.  Eric wanted to make it so that if you saved them, they would \nwander away, find their way back to the cages and get trapped again, but that was never implemented. The thing \nthat you start with in the inventory is your trusty dog Pep, who shows up in every Putt-Putt game and is \nmostly useless.  Here he continues the tradition.  There's only one thing you can do with him, on the first \nscreen. We recorded music, but it's not integrated into the game.  Maybe I'll upload some, or we'll release a \n1.1 with a title screen or something.  Dunno.  I get the feeling Eric's kind of tired of working on the game, \nand I don't want to push him if he's not enjoying the process. EDIT: Mac port \nadded.",

You should play it and tell me what you think of it so far. It is a game about \ndudes on a grid that need to get to a goal, except you can create more or less dudes by passing them through \nblocks larger than one square. I have four sets of levels that I'm calling \"worlds\".  The first world is a set \nof 4 \"this is how the game works\" levels.  The second world is a set of 3 \"mazey\" levels, which are good.  The \nthird world is a set of 3 levels involving enclosed squares, which act as crazy traps from which your dudes \ncan never escape.  These levels are also pretty good.  The fourth world is a set of 3 mediocre levels about \nbuilding weird shapes.  I don't think these are very interesting, but I am very interested to hear what your \nexperiences with them are like.",

It's a story \nof loss and lament, and involves a young boy and his troubles with being unable to attend the band's concert. \nOriginally a 1 scene 2 frame game, I have added 4 extra paths and some title pages, incorporated some new \ngameplay and added a tight but simple story.  I've included the Lyon library for those who have trouble \nrunning ZZT with sound and without crashes. The chapter selector is on the title screen and after a chapter is \nover the game must be reloaded to access other chapters (limits of zzt on the engine)  pressing O Space for \ninfo on the title screen is a farce, but just hold down shift+direction and you'll get the info provided. The \nadventure is short but I feel it has enough depth, laughter and overall tones of lament and acceptance that I \nfeel it is a good tone for this month, so I've resurrected this oldie but goodie as a red herring, but \nhopefully it's a good one others will enjoy, or overlook. So feel free to run it in zzt, lyon (included) or \nthe execution of your choice. Thanks go to Newt, Mew, ERI, the GT crew, Saxxonpike, mno, smedis, linhat, \nspindley or inspiration and whatnot..",

With your \ngive and take rewards, you were supposed to give J. CITIZEN support in fighting off dummy BUGS, but \nunfortunately they found out about you and started invading the compound - now you and J. CITIZEN will have to \nfend them off lest the only existing prototype for the MOTIVATING SPACE GUN is destroyed! GAMEPLAY: Use the \nSDWA or ARROW KEYS to move around. J. CITIZEN is so scared of the GREEN GATTLEBLAST BUGS that he will not be \nable to do more than hang on to you INFO: SCORE is, well, your score. Every new power of 10 reached sets the \nbullet count back to 1 - double that score for 2 bullets, triple it for 3, and so on. This system is meant to \nreward combatants for great achievement, and subsequently give them more challenge when they perform well. \nHEALTH is how many more hits J. CITIZEN can take before expiring, leaving you helpless against the damn BUGS! \nEvery 1000 points gained gives J. more confidence, allowing him to take another hit. BULLETS tells you \nstraightfowardly how many shots can be made at once. MONSTER HUNGER is a rating of how ravenous the BUGS have \ngotten - as it increases, so does the speed of BUGS, how well they can track you, and how many points killing \none is worth. SCORING: 1-80: You couldn't even kill a single GREEN GATTLEBLAST BUG? Either the MOTIVATING \nSPACE GUN is a failure, or YOU are! 81-1000: OK job - if you're a monkey 1001-5000: Good work, J. must be \nreally feeling the flow! 5001-10000: You made it as far as many would be expected too 10001+: Congratulations! \n20000+: Wow, that was quite a stretch!",

"Descr": "I'm of the opinion that, among many indie game puzzle platformers, the \"platformer\" part really doesn't add \nvery much to the \"puzzle\" part, especially ones which are clearly imitative of Portal. While Portal was \nostensibly a \"3D platformer\", that doesn't necessarily mean that its puzzles or puzzle design clarity \nnaturally degrades down to a 2D platformer. Too much focus is given on the length-height plane of Portal's \npuzzles, and, I feel, not enough on the length-width plane. So, in that vein, here are the first two levels of \na game that is not a puzzle platformer. WASD - Move. Mouse - Aim. Left click - Teleport. R - Restart. As it \nturns out it took ages to implement the special blocks' mechanics, so you only get 2 levels for now. Maybe in \nthe future more will come forth. The main inspiration for this was probably Epsilon, a somewhat \ndrearily-coloured Portal-inspired puzzle game that is, strictly speaking, not a platformer either. (Note: This \nmay seem like I'm especially talking about the recent indie release \"Gateways\" but I haven't actually played \nthat game outside of the first minute of the demo.)",

It is a \nbeast in size and without enough oomph even on my powerful netbook i've seen it do weird things like \ncharacters disappear and the like, so ....  This is dratmask, the plot is ... spoiler, it's a vn. Uhh, it's \nsort of like 2nd place as it's the sequel, and the song that gets played after 2nd place, so it's naturally a \nlonger song so the game is longer. A lot more work went into this one. Also if the game crashes after the \nsecond song is done playing, that's normal. That's the end of the game. I don't know how to make that not \nnormal, but this is okay. I may make some noise on the forums and ask real nicely and provide them with the \nsauce and whatnot. Major thanks go to: Erik for supplying the engine http://visualnovelty.com/index.html Mr. T \nfor supplying some voices Mikan of http://skimlines.com for supplying \"Wendy\" and in the first vn \"Peter\" mno \nscribb0 for the character grog this time around http://destructocon.com/ gen8's Anime Face Maker 2 \nhttp://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/289/5/5/anime_face_maker_2_by_gen8-d30uny4.swf disclaimer: opening the \nsauce 7z file is spoiler and was meant to do after the game, but i might have been to vague on hinting the \npassword, so yeah, change order there at your own discretion.

A lot of time, effort, and tears \n(maybe) has gone into it, and I think everything I've made for it reflects a lot of myself. Think of that what \nyou will. And before you ask: the gif above, sadly, does not reflect the actual game strongly. I just put that \ntogether for fun. If you are interested in working with the source and/or peeking at the secrets like the bad \nplayer you are, keep in mind that this was edited for release in The Games Factory 1, which isn't as easy to \nget as Klik'N'Play. I have no idea how backwards compatible this version would be in KNP, and I do know a \ncouple changes I've made would mess it up in KNP a little. As such I've uploaded the slightly older KNP files, \nwhich you can nab here. One of the frames in this version crashes sometimes and I have not been able to fix \nthis within KNP, sorry about that.",

Press Enter to begin. The basics are explained \non the title screen and in-game. This should hopefully satisfy all of ExciteMike's wishlist items: - being \nfunny! (I hope) - chasing (dogfighting) - being chased (cloud gods) - combos (your gold gets scattered when \nyou die, I guess that's close enough to a combo system) - unusual movement schemes - speed increasing as you \nplay (a bit hard to notice but it's there) - momentum (turning is momentum based, but kinda hard to notice) - \nnot even being able to control speed at all As a bonus, it also features a soundtrack taken from Donkey Kong \n94! An explanation of the different Special Events settings: None - No special events. Good for getting a feel \nfor the game. Random - The first two rounds don't have special events. All other rounds will feature either a \ncloud god or a dogfight, chosen at random. Dogfight Only - All rounds are dogfights. Cloud Gods Only - All \nrounds feature a randomly chosen cloud god. Keep in mind that this game has had no actual multiplayer testing. \nI'm not sure how balanced it is, but I did try to make some careful design considerations, EG. the ammo spawns \nat a random time during dogfight events, so let me know if I need to tweak anything. It also might have one or \ntwo small bugs left, and I was hoping to add some more cloud gods/tweakable settings. I might continuously \nupdate this thing, but for now I think it's ready for initial \nrelease.",

It sucks! This was a very long \nproject (Started on the 'PGC Forums') and took over a year to complete, because I suck at making games. :P \nCharacters: RobGBA Linkrulezall buzz-n64 Ray0fLightning Plot: RobGBA finds the rarest pirated game known on \neBay, and gives a HUGE bid!
