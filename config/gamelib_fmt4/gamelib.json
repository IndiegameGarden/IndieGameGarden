When it all goes to hell and Santa dies, press R to start over. Author:  Spencer \nGreen",

"Descr": "A little time ago I started thinking about a stealth game where enemies would track you by sense of smell. \nThis turned into a silly prototype where actually the enemies just have a larger collision radius and move in \nfixed paths, so it's not even really a \"stealth\" game. You control the last truffle on earth (trust me, I \nlooked at several pictures of truffles to try to get it right, if it looks like something else that's my lack \nof skill...) trying to avoid the pigs that can detect you if you get too close. Anyway, it was already on ice \nso, why not add it to this event... I just added some screens (title, game over) and another \n\"level\".",

"Descr": "I'm of the opinion that, among many indie game puzzle platformers, the \"platformer\" part really doesn't add \nvery much to the \"puzzle\" part, especially ones which are clearly imitative of Portal. While Portal was \nostensibly a \"3D platformer\", that doesn't necessarily mean that its puzzles or puzzle design clarity \nnaturally degrades down to a 2D platformer. Too much focus is given on the length-height plane of Portal's \npuzzles, and, I feel, not enough on the length-width plane. So, in that vein, here are the first two levels of \na game that is not a puzzle platformer. WASD - Move. Mouse - Aim. Left click - Teleport. R - Restart. Reach \nthe staircase to escape. As it turns out it took ages to implement the special blocks' mechanics, so you only \nget 2 levels for now. Maybe in the future more will come forth. The main inspiration for this was probably , a \nsomewhat drearily-coloured Portal-inspired puzzle game that is, strictly speaking, not a platformer either. \n(Note: This may seem like I'm especia...",

Bring the ball to the exit to progress to the next level. \nYou can drag the blue squares with the mouse. They are useful for guiding the ball toward or away from \ndifferent areas.

Piano \nplayers might get a kick out of its requirement for two-handed dexterity. For the second, I used the same \nisolated, scrolling level and the extra checkpoint, but with a single bee and I modified the controls so that \nthe bee accelerates upwards the entire time that the Up Arrow button is held down as opposed to the previous \nrequirement for several distinct button presses. The idea is to illustrate just how much a seemingly minor \ncontrol tweak can impact the âfeelâ of a gameâs play. The game is currently \nWindows-only.",

Maybe I'll make a version with crossfire later \nthis weekend. I wanted this to have the feeling of actual falling, like not just like spaceship mechanics or \nwhatever.

I've included the Lyon library for those who have trouble running \nZZT with sound and without crashes. The chapter selector is on the title screen and after a chapter is over \nthe game must be reloaded to access other chapters (limits of zzt on the engine) pressing O Space for info on \nthe title screen is a farce, but just hold down shift+direction and you'll get the info provided. The \nadventure is short but I feel it has enough depth, laughter and overall tones of lament and acceptance that I \nfeel it is a good tone for this month, so I've resurrected this oldie but goodie as a red herring, but \nhopefully it's a good one others wi...",

We started by writing a little (spoilers!), where we hashed out what the central \nconflict was, and who the characters are, and what the puzzles would be. Next we worked out the details of the \ngeography of the game by (spoilers!); I started drawing a few squares and linking them together, but pretty \nsoon he got the idea and insisted on taking over.

Although this game is fictional, the techniques described are pretty close to \nreality.

Some of the techniques not depicted in this game: -Encourage a \n\"community\" of victims and make them start reassuring each other and reaching out to their friends to help in \nrationalizing a logically unsound investment(a friend got me drawn in, in my own case) -Include accomplices to \nmake in-person visits to ...",

I've been poking at the project, off \nand on, for like a year now. Well, I've finally buckled down and finished something that other people can \ncheck out. CHECK IT OUT. The editing tool is not terribly far away from being publicly releasable; mostly just \nsome web backend stuff that needs tightening up. It occurred to me today that allowing Typing-of-the-Dead-like \nsegments where you have to actually type \"oh shit\" would make things much, much more interesting. So I'll \nprobably tackle that soon, too. Author:  Jeremy Penner",

You have 1024 balls and have to get as high a score as you can with them. What's \nthe most profitable way to do so? I'm not sure. Work it out yourself. Use the mouse to move the \npaddle.",

I rediscovered it again \nearlier this year; both the source and executable have miraculously survived her multiple computer changes \nover the last decade. It is a deeply personal game filled with extremely stupid jokes, awful spelling and some \nreferences only I would get (that's right, not even her).

"Descr": "Eric (age 4) was delighted with his Kickstarter reward game, , but he had a few ideas of his own that he \nwanted to see come to life. We left the original untouched, and simply added on to the end. You can skip there \nby pressing the \"E\" key at the first screen(s). First screen: A two-player ape vs. robot fight! Here you are \nmeant to bump into each other and go \"Aaugh, you got me!\" Second screen: Was actually made first; thus the \nexploration of the different objects. Here the robot is not controllable; his job is to run around pinching \neveryone. The helicopter thing happened by accident, but understanding it is key to moving on. Third screen: \nHere Eric remade the unicorn-riding segment to his own specifications. I'll let you discover what that means. \nFourth screen: He just wanted to see more plants.

Short tutorial: Aether is your action points. You can use it to select bricks in the Mountain and place \nnew ones on top of it. When you run out of aether, you lose. In order to have aether income, you have to \nmaintain Fear/Love balance as close to 0 as you can. To do that, drop bricks of different colors and see how \nthey shift balance (hint: red ones are going to become explosives later on). The game is turn-based. This has \nan obvious reason later on, but right now you just have to know that you can select 4 bricks in the front \nlayer per turn. (look for the Mac version in attachments)",

It reminds me of the soccer mode in Excitebike 64 : \nControls that, at first, seem cumbersome that with practice allow for satisfying, and fine, control. There are \na lot of neat ball control tricks. (Oh, that gives me an idea, actually: perhaps the ball should be still at \nthe start, and players come out to strike it. The strategy round that moment in ExciteBike 64 was one of my \nfavourite things about that game.) Author:  Rylie James Thomas",

Then, \nthe second-last and third-last letters in that word become the third and fourth letters of your next word. See \nhow long you can keep devising words that fit within these constraints. The lower-left corner shows a \nthumbnail of the entire game board as you have filled it so far. This time I've left the more specific game \nconstraints outside the game, leaving it up to the player to decide how to play. For instance, it doesn't \ncheck words against a dictionary file, so the arbiter for whether a word is 'good' is only you. It is also up \nto you to choose whether to avoid words already entered. You can also use this to play a two-player game where \nyou take turns entering words. This is intended to be as vacant of refereeing as a mere pencil and paper are. \nFor inclusion in the Pirate Kart, consult the Zip file. Author:  Leon Arnott",

Collect EVIDENCE and \nbust PERPS by rolling your car into them. If you want to connect with an informant, STOP your car and they \nwill walk to you. (as long as they are not blocked) If you crash into buildings too many times, you will end \nthe game by taking a desk job for the department. (Don't worry, you won't be fired.) THANK YOU FOR PLAYING! \nCreated in a day for Glorious Trainwrecks. Inspired by the NES game âMotor City Patrolâ and over 15 years \nof living in Baltimore City, Maryland, USA.",

Eating all the cakes will unlock all the locks and allow \nyou to leave the level. Locks without a block can be pasted through and will turn into lockblocks when you go \nover them. I don't know why you leave blocks behind you, but otherwise the game is unplayable, so I guess \nthat's the reason :P.

The third \nline is the line number where, when the top half of Jane enters, Jane does a victory dance. The fourth line is \nthe line number where the skewers, if any, start to break up. Then there's at most 598 lines of text that are, \nat most, 8 characters long. Missing lines are assumed to be blank. Each line corresponds to a row of blocks in \nthe tomb.

Controls: Player 1: W/S Player 2: Up/Down Edit: - Fixed a silly bounds error that prevented \nthe inner paddles and ball from moving in the entire outer ball. - Fixed an asymmetry in the paddle positions. \n- Added a short delay before either ball starts moving at the beginning of the \ngame.",

"Descr": "A dumb game I made roughly ten years ago in The Games Factory. You must catch as many poorly-drawn mice as \npossible by placing mouse traps near them. You can't place them too close to the mice to start with or else \nthe game will play a buzzer. Lazy, I know. Then you pray for the mice to decide to wander over toward the \ntrap. You can attract the mice with cheese by holding the right mouse button (best done in light taps) but you \nonly have a limited amount, and using it drains your points. Features annoying sound effects. This game sucks, \nbut it doesn't suck as much as Winning Square or Toy Motor Boat Sim.",

When your toy boat fills up with water, you must empty it by shaking it or else it will half-capsize. \nHold Ctrl and mash Space to shake the water out of the toy boat. Press the X in the top-right corner of the \nwindow to stop playing this game. Which is what you should be doing because much like Winning Square, this \ngame sucks.",

Arrows - Impart motion upon self, or, conversely, aim the object held in hand (if \nany). X - ??? C - ???",

Each \nplayer is equipped with a gun and a forcefield. Like Pong, the aim of the game is to bat the grenade off the \nopposite side of the screen. Unlike pong, you can only deflect the ball when your forcefield is activated, and \nyour forcefield only stays active for about 1/3rd of a second each time you use it (and takes just over 1 \nsecond to recharge). If you touch the bomb while your forcefield is inactive, you lose instantly. But wait - \nthere's more! You can't move and fire.

Instead, matching cards gradually reveals a password hidden beneath the playing field. Enter the \npassword as soon as you can see what it is, and you've won the round. Faster games, with less needless and \naimless clicking, is Memory Improved's promise. \"Diddled Bits\" font by Anne Thoreau \nP.",

I guess this was to discourage lazy bums like me from hanging around after check-out time. The remainder \nof the dream involved picking up all my junk from around the cottage and its garden, while evading or fighting \noff zombies. This is the game of that dream, created in Game Maker 7. Your goal is to pick up your five \nremaining t-shirts and stuff them into the bag before the zombies get you. There is no sound because I wasted \nfar too much time drawing zombies.
