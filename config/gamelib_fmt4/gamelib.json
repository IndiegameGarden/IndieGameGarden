When it all goes to hell and Santa dies, press R to start over. Author:  Spencer \nGreen",

"Descr": "A little time ago I started thinking about a stealth game where enemies would track you by sense of smell. \nThis turned into a silly prototype where actually the enemies just have a larger collision radius and move in \nfixed paths, so it's not even really a \"stealth\" game. You control the last truffle on earth (trust me, I \nlooked at several pictures of truffles to try to get it right, if it looks like something else that's my lack \nof skill...) trying to avoid the pigs that can detect you if you get too close. Anyway, it was already on ice \nso, why not add it to this event... I just added some screens (title, game over) and another \n\"level\".",

"Descr": "I'm of the opinion that, among many indie game puzzle platformers, the \"platformer\" part really doesn't add \nvery much to the \"puzzle\" part, especially ones which are clearly imitative of Portal. While Portal was \nostensibly a \"3D platformer\", that doesn't necessarily mean that its puzzles or puzzle design clarity \nnaturally degrades down to a 2D platformer. Too much focus is given on the length-height plane of Portal's \npuzzles, and, I feel, not enough on the length-width plane. So, in that vein, here are the first two levels of \na game that is not a puzzle platformer. WASD - Move. Mouse - Aim. Left click - Teleport. R - Restart. Reach \nthe staircase to escape. As it turns out it took ages to implement the special blocks' mechanics, so you only \nget 2 levels for now. Maybe in the future more will come forth. The main inspiration for this was probably , a \nsomewhat drearily-coloured Portal-inspired puzzle game that is, strictly speaking, not a platformer either. \n(Note: This may seem like I'm especia...",

Bring the ball to the exit to progress to the next level. \nYou can drag the blue squares with the mouse. They are useful for guiding the ball toward or away from \ndifferent areas.

Maybe I'll make a version with crossfire later \nthis weekend. I wanted this to have the feeling of actual falling, like not just like spaceship mechanics or \nwhatever.

I've included the Lyon library for those who have trouble running \nZZT with sound and without crashes. The chapter selector is on the title screen and after a chapter is over \nthe game must be reloaded to access other chapters (limits of zzt on the engine) pressing O Space for info on \nthe title screen is a farce, but just hold down shift+direction and you'll get the info provided. The \nadventure is short but I feel it has enough depth, laughter and overall tones of lament and acceptance that I \nfeel it is a good tone for this month, so I've resurrected this oldie but goodie as a red herring, but \nhopefully it's a good one others wi...",

We started by writing a little (spoilers!), where we hashed out what the central \nconflict was, and who the characters are, and what the puzzles would be. Next we worked out the details of the \ngeography of the game by (spoilers!); I started drawing a few squares and linking them together, but pretty \nsoon he got the idea and insisted on taking over.

Although this game is fictional, the techniques described are pretty close to \nreality.

Some of the techniques not depicted in this game: -Encourage a \n\"community\" of victims and make them start reassuring each other and reaching out to their friends to help in \nrationalizing a logically unsound investment(a friend got me drawn in, in my own case) -Include accomplices to \nmake in-person visits to ...",

I've been poking at the project, off \nand on, for like a year now. Well, I've finally buckled down and finished something that other people can \ncheck out. CHECK IT OUT. The editing tool is not terribly far away from being publicly releasable; mostly just \nsome web backend stuff that needs tightening up. It occurred to me today that allowing Typing-of-the-Dead-like \nsegments where you have to actually type \"oh shit\" would make things much, much more interesting. So I'll \nprobably tackle that soon, too. Author:  Jeremy Penner",

You have 1024 balls and have to get as high a score as you can with them. What's \nthe most profitable way to do so? I'm not sure. Work it out yourself. Use the mouse to move the \npaddle.",

I rediscovered it again \nearlier this year; both the source and executable have miraculously survived her multiple computer changes \nover the last decade. It is a deeply personal game filled with extremely stupid jokes, awful spelling and some \nreferences only I would get (that's right, not even her).

We left the original untouched, and simply added on to the end. You can skip there \nby pressing the \"E\" key at the first screen(s). First screen: A two-player ape vs. robot fight! Here you are \nmeant to bump into each other and go \"Aaugh, you got me!\" Second screen: Was actually made first; thus the \nexploration of the different objects. Here the robot is not controllable; his job is to run around pinching \neveryone. The helicopter thing happened by accident, but understanding it is key to moving on. Third screen: \nHere Eric remade the unicorn-riding segment to his own specifications. I'll let you discover what that means. \nFourth screen: He just wanted to see more plants.

Short tutorial: Aether is your action points. You can use it to select bricks in the Mountain and place \nnew ones on top of it. When you run out of aether, you lose. In order to have aether income, you have to \nmaintain Fear/Love balance as close to 0 as you can. To do that, drop bricks of different colors and see how \nthey shift balance (hint: red ones are going to become explosives later on). The game is turn-based. This has \nan obvious reason later on, but right now you just have to know that you can select 4 bricks in the front \nlayer per turn. (look for the Mac version in attachments)",

It reminds me of the soccer mode in Excitebike 64 : \nControls that, at first, seem cumbersome that with practice allow for satisfying, and fine, control. There are \na lot of neat ball control tricks. (Oh, that gives me an idea, actually: perhaps the ball should be still at \nthe start, and players come out to strike it. The strategy round that moment in ExciteBike 64 was one of my \nfavourite things about that game.) Author:  Rylie James Thomas",

"Descr": "Game link:  This is just a simple word game I devised. Write a word that's at least 5 characters long. Then, \nthe second-last and third-last letters in that word become the third and fourth letters of your next word. See \nhow long you can keep devising words that fit within these constraints. The lower-left corner shows a \nthumbnail of the entire game board as you have filled it so far. This time I've left the more specific game \nconstraints outside the game, leaving it up to the player to decide how to play. For instance, it doesn't \ncheck words against a dictionary file, so the arbiter for whether a word is 'good' is only you. It is also up \nto you to choose whether to avoid words already entered. You can also use this to play a two-player game where \nyou take turns entering words. This is intended to be as vacant of refereeing as a mere pencil and paper are. \nFor inclusion in the Pirate Kart, consult the Zip file. Author:  Leon Arnott",

Click on \"CAKE\" to \nbegin, use the Arrow Keys to move Febe around. It's a combination between Pacman and one of those ice level \nthings that you have to do in ice caves in Pokemon. Eating all the cakes will unlock all the locks and allow \nyou to leave the level. Locks without a block can be pasted through and will turn into lockblocks when you go \nover them. I don't know why you leave blocks behind you, but otherwise the game is unplayable, so I guess \nthat's the reason :P. Oh and my sister's called Febe (which is like Phoebe, but Dutch) Press 'R' if you get \nstuck! Hope you enjoy! :D Also, cake.",

The third \nline is the line number where, when the top half of Jane enters, Jane does a victory dance. The fourth line is \nthe line number where the skewers, if any, start to break up. Then there's at most 598 lines of text that are, \nat most, 8 characters long. Missing lines are assumed to be blank. Each line corresponds to a row of blocks in \nthe tomb.

Naturally, I opened The Games Factory and made \na game about it. Use Left and Right arrow keys to turn. Press and hold Shift to pull the string, and release \nto move. When your toy boat fills up with water, you must empty it by shaking it or else it will half-capsize. \nHold Ctrl and mash Space to shake the water out of the toy boat. Press the X in the top-right corner of the \nwindow to stop playing this game. Which is what you should be doing because much like Winning Square, this \ngame sucks.",

Each \nplayer is equipped with a gun and a forcefield. Like Pong, the aim of the game is to bat the grenade off the \nopposite side of the screen. Unlike pong, you can only deflect the ball when your forcefield is activated, and \nyour forcefield only stays active for about 1/3rd of a second each time you use it (and takes just over 1 \nsecond to recharge). If you touch the bomb while your forcefield is inactive, you lose instantly. But wait - \nthere's more! You can't move and fire.

Instead, matching cards gradually reveals a password hidden beneath the playing field. Enter the \npassword as soon as you can see what it is, and you've won the round. Faster games, with less needless and \naimless clicking, is Memory Improved's promise. \"Diddled Bits\" font by Anne Thoreau \nP.",

I guess this was to discourage lazy bums like me from hanging around after check-out time. The remainder \nof the dream involved picking up all my junk from around the cottage and its garden, while evading or fighting \noff zombies. This is the game of that dream, created in Game Maker 7. Your goal is to pick up your five \nremaining t-shirts and stuff them into the bag before the zombies get you. There is no sound because I wasted \nfar too much time drawing zombies.

Collect money from your housemates to steal a spaceship to get back home to \n[not included] stop evil aliens from taking over. Eventually led to two completed sequels and one that was in \nthe works. All of which have since been lost. Level 1: 8-way movement = Move Collect all coins to advance to \nnext level. Collision with enemies restarts entire level. Level 2: Platform movement = Move Button 1 = Jump \nGet to LEM to finish level. Getting hit with asteroids restarts entire level. Level 3: Controls in-game Button \n1 = shoot Shoot all asteroids to complete level. Collision with asteroids restarts entire level. Level 4: Same \nas last level. Get to Mars to finish level.",
